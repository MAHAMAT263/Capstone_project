## üìò Overview

**ChFarmGuard** is an IoT and computer vision-based system designed to detect animal intrusions in farmlands and send real-time alerts to farmers. The system aims to prevent crop destruction and reduce farmer-herder conflicts, particularly in rural Chad, where such issues are common. Using low-cost devices such as Raspberry Pi, camera modules, and GSM/Internet communication, the system automatically identifies livestock (e.g., goats, cows, camels) and alerts farmers via mobile notifications or sound deterrents.

## üß© Objectives

* **Main Objective:**
  To design and deploy a low-cost IoT system capable of detecting, classifying, and alerting farmers about livestock intrusion in real-time.

* **Specific Objectives:**

  * Review existing literature on IoT and computer vision for intrusion detection.
  * Develop a prototype integrating Raspberry Pi, camera modules, and alert mechanisms.
  * Evaluate the system using detection accuracy, false alarm rate, and user feedback.

---

## ‚ùì Research Questions

1. Can a local IoT-computer vision system accurately detect and classify animals entering farmlands?
2. How do edge-based (Raspberry Pi) and cloud-based models compare in performance?
3. Can real-time notifications reduce crop loss and prevent farmer-herder conflicts?

---

## üîç Project Scope

The system focuses on smallholder farms, tested in Rwanda but designed for deployment in rural Chad. It targets medium-to-large livestock such as cows and goats, and can be extended for camels. The project emphasizes cost-effectiveness and offline functionality.

## üí° Significance

ChFarmGuard contributes to:

* Preventing crop destruction through early intrusion alerts.
* Reducing violent farmer-herder conflicts.
* Promoting food security and peacebuilding using affordable digital technology.

## üìà System Flow

1. Camera captures image/video.
2. Raspberry Pi processes input with ML model.
3. Detected animal classified (e.g., goat, cow ).
4. Alert sent to farmer‚Äôs mobile via FCM.
5. Optional deterrent (sound/alarm) triggered.

## üî¨ Methodology

The **prototype development model** is used to allow iterative testing of each module (camera input, ML inference, alert system). This ensures adaptability to real farm conditions and efficient system refinement.



## üß© Conclusion

ChFarmGuard bridges the gap between traditional farm protection and modern technology. It provides a practical, scalable, and affordable solution that empowers rural farmers to safeguard their crops, reduce losses, and foster peace in conflict-prone areas.
